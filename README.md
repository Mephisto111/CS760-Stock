Team members are divided into two groups to complete different tasksï¼š 1 Data processing; 2 Model Architecture

The model Architecture part contains: 


The code of ANN1.ipynb is designed to predict gold prices using a multi-layer miner regression model (MLPRegressor) and explain the contribution of the model predictions through SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations). The data includes sentiment analysis results of reviews from multiple sources and gold transaction data.
